= TODO for the cataliner-framework repo

* As the code came from a sanitized origins of an internal project, make sure it still works after the clean-up ;)
* Review packaging procedures for SVR4 and RPM to automate respins of packages; automate as much as possible by a Makefile.
* Publish the downloadable PKG and RPM packages at e.g. a special branch of this project.
* Provide some more examples, e.g. the more-aggressive Java Garbage Collector tuning solutions.
* Explore systemd integration for Linux.
